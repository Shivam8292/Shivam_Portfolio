## 🌐 Overview
Welcome to the source code of my digital portfolio. This project isn't just a static resume—it is a deeply engineered **Kinetic System** built to demonstrate advanced proficiency in performance optimization, WebGL/Canvas rendering, and complex state management within the React ecosystem.

The aesthetic direction follows a strict philosophy of **Cinematic Brutalism**. By discarding traditional soft UI patterns (glassmorphism, subtle drop-shadows) in favor of stark contrast, heavy-weight typography, raw film grain, and 60fps physics-driven interactions, the portfolio acts as an immersive, tactile experience. 

It also highlights my core engineering proficiencies: **FastAPI**, **React**, **LangChain**, and **RAG systems**.

## ⚡ Core Features

### 1. The Kinetic Engine (Zero-Lag Canvas Renderers)
Standard DOM manipulation is notoriously slow for continuous physics interactions. To maintain a strict 60fps experience, this project uses bare-metal HTML5 `<canvas>` layers for high-frequency animations:
* **Molecular Cursor (`Cursor.tsx`)**: A custom 20-node physics trail algorithm that physically replaces the native cursor. It calculates velocity, friction, and boundary collisions natively via `requestAnimationFrame`.
* **Velocity Warp (`VelocityWarp.tsx`)**: An event-driven directional speed-line system. It dynamically intercepts massive navigation jumps across the DOM and strictly masks the viewport, executing a high-speed travel simulation before a flawless 1.5-second deceleration reveal.

### 2. Deep Localization (Global Context Provider)
The portfolio dynamically translates the localized interfaces into over 10 distinct regions (`en`, `ja`, `ko`, `zh-tw`, `hi`, `fr`, `de`, `it`, `es`, etc.). The structure seamlessly handles character slicing, font-weight shifting (supporting CJK languages seamlessly), and layout restructuring without triggering hydration errors.

### 3. Cinematic Transition Orchestration (`FlipContext.tsx`)
A completely custom global transition router:
* Built a state machine capable of hijacking hard navigation events.
* Smoothly transitions the application state to trigger pre-loading mechanisms, execute WebGL-like 3D card flips (`FlipTransition.tsx`), or spatial warps before firing a sanitized redirect.

### 4. Performance Engineering (Heap Memory Management)
This portfolio has been rigorously optimized to maintain a low memory footprint (Targeting <100MB Heap usage in Chrome):
* **Lifecycle-Aware Animators**: All `animejs` and Canvas loops in components like `VelocityWarp.tsx` and `BinaryVeil.tsx` are bound to `IntersectionObserver` logic and explicit cleanup handlers (`anime.remove`). They cease all processing when out of view, preventing memory leaks and CPU spikes.
* **Aggressive Code Splitting**: Utilizing `next/dynamic` for heavy sections (`About`, `Projects`, `Contact`) to minimize initial JS payload and prevent unnecessary script execution on entry.
* **Resource Throttling**: Video and high-res asset preloading is state-managed (e.g., `preload="metadata"`) to prevent unneeded multi-megabyte downloads during initial hydration.

### 5. Unified Kinetic Motion (`LanguageSelector.tsx`)
A custom-built "Shutter Unroll" materialization system that replaces standard CSS transforms with a synchronized, physics-driven staggered reveal. By orchestrating individual item materialization with the container's clip-path unroll, the UI feels alive and responsive to user intent.

## 🔒 Security & Performance Constraints
This repository uses `next/dynamic` to selectively disable Server-Side Rendering (`ssr: false`) on physics-heavy client-side components to eliminate content flashing. High-intensity interactive elements (such as `ImageGuard.tsx`) aggressively prevent outside ghosting, dragging, and unwanted context menus to enforce the application-like feel. 

All CSS animations conform to user preference media queries (`@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`).
